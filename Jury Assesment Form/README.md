I played a key role in **developing the Scoring System** for the **13th PaDaeng National Angklung Music Competition**, focusing on **redesigning the assessment process** to be more **efficient, accurate, and accessible online**.

### Key Contributions
- Developed a **digital scoring system** to replace the manual assessment process.
- Implemented methods to **eliminate extreme scores** for accurate evaluations.
- Enhanced **transparency** through standardized ranking calculations.
- Provided **data-driven insights** to support chief organizers and the advisory board in making informed decisions.

## About the Competition

The **Angklung PaDaeng Music Competition (LMAP)** is a **biennial national competition** organized by the **Student Activity Unit of the Bumi Siliwangi Family**.
Held at the **Indonesian University of Education (UPI)**, this event serves as a platform for participants across various categories:

- Kindergarten
- Elementary School
- Junior High School
- High School
- College Students
- General Public

---

## Issues

The previous scoring system relied heavily on a **manual assessment method**, where judges submitted scores separately. This caused several key issues:

- **Calculation errors** due to manual input and human mistakes.
- Difficulty handling **extreme scores**, impacting fairness.
- Frequent **ties in rankings**, making it hard to determine winners.
- **Inefficient offline processing**, delaying result announcements.

---

## Objectives

To ensure accurate results, it is important to clean and format the data properly. The following steps should be taken:

- Remove rows with empty values.
- Adjust the data format by converting mismatched data types.

**Apply color formatting** in Input Sheet to highlight problematic values in red if they meet any of these conditions:

- Value is empty
- Value is 0
- Value is less than 30
- Contains letters

Additionally, an **indicator** should be added to ensure jury input completion, verifying that all necessary data has been entered correctly.

To improve accuracy and efficiency in the judging process, the committee aimed to:

- Compare **three assessment methods** to find the fairest approach:
  1. Summing all scores from each judge.
  2. Eliminating the highest and lowest scores.
  3. Calculating ranking scores from each judge.
- Introduce **standardization features** to prevent identical participant scores.
- Transition from **offline** to a **fully accessible online system**.
- Refine the **scoring formula** for better clarity and usability.
- **Automate** the reporting process to instantly generate:
  - Legger (score summary)
  - Report cards
  - Champion certificates

---

## Processes & Considerations

The dataset was organized into several interconnected sheets:

- **Input Sheet** – Raw scores with data cleaning and validation to remove empty or invalid values.
- **Conversion Sheet** – Standardized score conversion for consistency.
- **Legger Sheet** – Recap of processed scores for integration.
- **Raport Sheet** – Automatically generated results with rankings.
- **Champion Sheet** – Final winners, consolation awards, and special recognitions.

</p>

**Key Approaches:**
- Applied **score standardization** and removed extreme values for fairness.
- Automated **lookup functions** to dynamically pull data across sheets.
- Final results validated with **jury signatures** for transparency.
